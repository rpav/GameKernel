# GameKernel

GameKernel is a command-driven "kernel" of game functionality.  Its
goal is to be a fast, portable, *language-friendly* group of
pure C API functionality:

* Minimal FFI
* Data/command-driven structure
* Bridge to useful C++ libs

One can render an entire scene with as few as *1* C call per frame.
Right now, this includes the following:

* NanoVG for drawing, text, etc
* Sprite/quad buffering
* Transformation/matrices
* Spritesheets, TexturePacker json parsing
* A nicer C++ API called `gk++` that wraps the C API

This is *not* an engine---there is no scene handling, animation,
render loop.  It will not even create windows and context; use SDL2 or
similar.  Rather, if you are *writing* an engine, or you want to write
a game with a great deal of control, you would want GameKernel as your
core.

In the works, no particular order:

* Box2D integration
* More complete NanoVG support
* RenderTexture
* 3D
* More language wrappers

# Work In Progress

This is, quite obviously, a work-in-progress.  It started as a
week-long project in preparation for the [Spring 2016 Lisp Game
Jam](https://itch.io/jam/spring-2016-lisp-game-jam), and has continued
from there.

Some things are likely to change wildly---data structure layouts and
constants, for instance.  However, the actual names are relatively
stable, though this may not be the case always.

# Example Code

Currently there are a few examples in the `examples/` directory.  The
original examples 1â€“3 are more-or-less plain C with a bit of C++.  This
isn't very friendly.

However, with the new `gk++` API, this is changing.  An updated
version of `example1` called `example1a` shows the differences.  New
examples will be created this way, because they're easier to read and
write.

# Building

GLM and GLEW are required to be installed.

0. Make sure to `git submodule update --init`.  This depends on numerous submodules.
0. Create a subdirectory for building.
0. Run `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="RelWithDebInfo" ..` (or "Release").  Note GLM performs *significantly* faster with at least some optimization.  Building "Debug" will be very slow.
0. Run `make; make install`.

```console
vcs $ git clone ... gamekernel
vcs $ cd gamekernel
gamekernel $ git submodule update --init
gamekernel $ mkdir build; cd build
build $ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE="RelWithDebInfo"
build $ make ; make install
```

Examples are also built and should be in `build/examples`.

# Basic Design

## API

Part of the idea is to minimize function calls, since FFI from other
languages tends to be expensive, and merely setting data structures
hypothetically less so.  Thus, there are a total of *three* functions:

* `gk_context* gk_create(gk_impl)`: Return a GK context. Currently only GK_GL3 is implemented.  This requires an OpenGL 3.3 Core profile.
* `void gk_process(gk_context *gk, gk_bundle *bundle)`: This is the function you call to get things done.  This takes the context, and a bundle.  On return, the bundle contains any relevant error code.
* `void gk_destroy(gk_context*)`: This cleans up the context.

There is a single header:

* `gk/gk.h`:  This contains all definitions.

## Bundles, Passes, Lists, Commands

Conceptually, you should think of processing a series of *passes*.
For instance, you might have a pass that renders sprites, and a pass
that renders UI, and maybe a pass that composites them (once
render-to-texture is supported!).  How passes work is entirely
determined by you.  This affords a great deal of flexibility in game
rendering.

Each of these passes processes a *list* of *commands*.  The `gk_list`
struct holds 3 things:

* The `gk_subsystem`: currently GK_SUB_CONFIG, GK_SUB_GL, GK_SUB_NVG; this
  is which subsystem processes the list.  Some subsystems may process
  commands differently.
* The number of commands, and an array of pointers to those commands.

It is assumed that commands may be statically held and reused.  It is
generally safe to have a command on multiple lists, and call it
multiple times in a row.  It is generally safe to process the same
list multiple times in a row.  It is *not* generally safe to process
the same command (or list) with two different contexts, or from two
different threads with the same context.  Exceptions will be
explicitly noted in either case.

A *pass* is a specific kind of command, which references a *list
index*, and whether the list should be pre-sorted.  Note that sorting
modifies the list in-place.

A *bundle* holds an array of the lists you wish processed in a single
call, as well as a "starting pass" which determines the first list to
be processed.  The "list index" of a pass refers to this array.
Because a pass is just another command, to process multiple passes in
a single call, you would create a list of pass commands, and process
this as the first pass.

*Commands* are the fundamental unit of "getting something done".
These may be anything from loading or freeing a sprite sheet to
actually rendering something on the screen.  Any command has either a
`gk_cmd` or another command with `gk_cmd` as its first member, and may
be safely cast (or treated as) a `gk_cmd`.  `gk_cmd` itself has a few
basic fields:

* `gk_cmd_type type`: This specifies what the command is
* `int key`: This is an arbitrary integer key.  If a pass specifies
  sorting, this is the sort key.

For a reference of all the commands, see `gk/gk.h`, and the examples
for demonstration.
